# ShuttleTrack

This is developed app from the needs of personal experience. Many a times I have been waiting for the shuttle in the stop and at times wait for hours before the shuttle turn up. Even though we have the schedule for the shuttle, the students at many times due to delay of turn up of the shuttle often waste a lot of time waiting for the bus to come or in anticipating the arrival of bus.
This app will give the student the idea of where their intended shuttle is and how much time will it take to arrive at the nearest stop to the student. The students will have an option to report whether they have boarded the shuttle or that the shuttle is delayed.
Through crowd sourcing the location of the shuttle is depicted.
